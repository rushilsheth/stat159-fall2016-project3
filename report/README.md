  This is the report folder. Due to the nature of our responsibility assigned, we only include the whole report instead of creating
  section folder. Basically, each team member write their own part, send it to the member that's responsible for compiling the whole
  report. As a reference, here's a breakdown of author of each section:
   * Introduction, Abstract, Data Cleaning, EDA Analysis, Conclusion: Yuyu Zhang
   * Methods, Analysis: Atul Lanka
   * Shiny: Timothy Park
   * Compilation of reprot: Rushil Seth
