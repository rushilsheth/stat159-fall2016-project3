 \section{Shiny App}

In order to gain more insight into our data set on California art schools, we made a shiny app that would facilitate users to understand the difference of certain statistics between each school and how they correlate to higher graduation rates. Using the shiny app, we are able to construct bar charts and pie charts that would give visual aid to readers on which school is the better of a certain pair. The following class types are the main indicators and predictors we used for our regression models: gender, ethnicity, graduation rate, average age, and median income. The selected groups consist of not only specific academic institutions, but also the three separated regions in California: Northern, Central, and Southern. Given an insufficient data set, there is no clean data for the art schools in Central California, so the charts are not shown.

One piece of information to consider is how graduation rates in Southern California are relatively higher than the rates in Northern California. Especially in graduation rates for the white race, the graduation rate in Southern in California is higher by approximately two-fold. From the ethnicity class type, we can see that Asians and Hispanics are enrolled more in Southern California. This case may be related to a regionâ€™s demographic information, but it may be an indicator that having more Asians or Hispanics can lead to a higher graduation rate. In addition, comparing two schools from Southern and Northern California (Argosy University in San Diego and the San Francisco Conservatory of Music), we can see that the average age is relatively higher in San Diego while the median income is relatively lower in San Diego. A high average age with low median income can be related to lower graduation rates; however, a higher age group is more matured in terms of careers and academics, so a higher age group can be correlated to higher g
