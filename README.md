##Makefile Commands
 The Makefile in this directory contains a number of phony targets which run different pieces of the data acquisition, cleaning, model fitting, analysis, app building and report. To run certain targets, simply type "make target_name" into the terminal. Here is a list of the phony target titles:
• all: runs the main aspects of our project: Exploratory data analysis, Model creation, and Report compiling/rendering  
• data: downloads the file Credit.csv to the folder data/    
• eda: performs the exploratory data analysis  
• ols: OLS regression  
• ridge: Rdige Regression  
• lasso: Lasso Regression  
• pcr: Principal Components Regression  
• plsr: Partial Least Squares Regression  
• regressions: all five regressions    
• report: concatenates the .Rmd report from the individual sections, and then render the report.pdf  
• slides: generates the actual slides.html from our slides.Rmd  
• session-info: generates session-info.txt  
• shiny: run the shiny app 
• clean: deletes the generated report files, both .Rmd and .pdf
